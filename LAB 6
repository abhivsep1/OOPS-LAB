#q1] Write a program to create a class called "Person" with a name and age attribute. Create two instances of the "Person" class, set their attributes using the constructor, and print their name and age. 

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

person1 = Person("Alice", 30)
person2 = Person("Bob", 25)

print(f"Person 1: Name = {person1.name}, Age = {person1.age}")
print(f"Person 2: Name = {person2.name}, Age = {person2.age}")

#q2] Create a class named 'Student' with String variable 'name' and integer variable 'roll_no'. Assign the value of roll no as '2' and that of name as "John" by creating an object of the class Student. 
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, roll_no):
        self.name = name
        self.roll_no = roll_no

student1 = Student("John", 2)

print(f"Student Name: {student1.name}")
print(f"Roll Number: {student1.roll_no}")

#q3] Write a program to define a class to represent a bank account, with methods to deposit, withdraw, and check the balance.
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, initial_balance=0):
        self.balance = initial_balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        if amount > 0:
            self.balance += amount
            print(f"Deposited: {amount}. Current balance: {self.balance}")
        else:
            print("Deposit amount must be greater than zero.")

    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if amount > 0:
            if amount <= self.balance:
                self.balance -= amount
                print(f"Withdrew: {amount}. Current balance: {self.balance}")
            else:
                print("Insufficient funds!")
        else:
            print("Withdrawal amount must be greater than zero.")

    def check_balance(self):
        print(f"Current balance: {self.balance}")

account = BankAccount(1000) 
account.check_balance()  # Check the initial balance

account.deposit(500)  # Deposit $500
account.withdraw(200)  # Withdraw $200
account.check_balance()  # Check the balance after transactions
account.withdraw(1500)  # Try to withdraw more than the balance

#q4]⁠Write a program to define a class Student with attributes like name and age, and create objects to represent different students.
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def display_info(self):
        print(f"Student Name: {self.name}, Age: {self.age}")

student1 = Student("Alice", 20)
student2 = Student("Bob", 22)
student3 = Student("Charlie", 19)

student1.display_info()
student2.display_info()
student3.display_info()
